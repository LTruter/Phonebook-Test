# Phonebook-Test
I successfully developed an "Add Contact" page using HTML, CSS, and PHP, incorporating both client-side and server-side validation for form inputs. I established a MySQL database connection, running it locally via XAMPP. Additionally, I implemented validation checks for the database connection and wrote code to automatically create the database and table.
